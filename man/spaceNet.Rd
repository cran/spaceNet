\title{Latent Space Models for Multivariate Networks}

\description{
A package for latent space models for binary multivariate networks (multiplex).
The model assumes that the nodes in the multiplex lie in a low-dimensional latent space. The probability of two nodes being connected is inversely related to their distance in this latent space: nodes close in the space are more likely to be linked, while nodes that are far apart are less likely to be connected.
Inference is carried out via a MCMC algorithm.
}


\details{ %%%to do
The main function is \code{\link{multiNet}}, which estimates the latent space model via MCMC algorithm. Data can be inputed either as a list or an array. Also, edge-specific covariates in the form of a list or an array can be included in the model.
